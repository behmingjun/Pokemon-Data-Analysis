# Pokemon-Data-Analysis
Gotta catch'em all :)

Some data analysis on the pokemons stats (ATK, DEF, SPD etc.) based on their types and whether they are lengendary or not.
Also tried linear regression to look at correlation between Total stats and HP stats.
Explored classification tree to correctly identify if a pokemon is legendary or not based on its stats.
